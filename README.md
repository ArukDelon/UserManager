# UserManager
The program I am developing is a user management application. It allows users to perform various operations on a list of users, such as adding new users, editing existing user information, deleting users, and sorting the user list based on different criteria.

The application features a user interface where users can interact with the functionality provided. It includes forms for inputting user data, displaying the list of users in a table or grid format, and buttons or controls for performing different actions.

Additionally, the application supports sorting of the user list based on properties such as first name, last name, age, active status, and email. Users can toggle the sorting order between ascending and descending.

The program aims to provide a user-friendly and efficient way to manage user data. It utilizes various programming concepts, such as data models, view models, and commands, to implement the desired functionality.
